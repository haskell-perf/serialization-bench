Benchmarks for Haskell serialization libraries.

For every library, we measure the serialization time, deserialization time and size of the encoded output for a set of test datasets.

## Summary Results

The summary tables list, for every test, all libraries that are within 30% of the best result (with best library listed first).

### Transfer Time

To merge all measures in a concrete use case, we estimate the total transfer time at different transmission speeds, that's to say the the time that it takes to serialize, move across a network (with no compression and no protocol overheads) and deserialize a given dataset.

When the network speed is low, transfer times are dominated by the size of the encoded dataset. At higher speeds, by the (de)serialisation times.

Tests are executed on an Intel Xeon W3520 @ 2.67GHz. On a slower machine, de(serialization) times would matter more, on a faster machine size would be more significant.

## Tested Libraries

Performance is not the only relevant property, depending on your needs you should also consider other features like laziness and compatibility.

Shout if you would like other tests to be added!

## Running the Benchmarks

Run the benchmarks with:

`stack bench :all`

If you get this error:

`...<stdout>: commitBuffer: invalid argument (invalid character)`

Try:

`export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`

The executable will write the *report.md*, *report.html* and *report.json* files containing the full test results and will print out the two summary results tables in markdown format.

Tests will be compiled with GHC 8.4.4.
